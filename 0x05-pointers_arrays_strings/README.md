# Learning Objectives
- What are pointers and how to use them
- What are arrays and how to use them
- What are the differences between pointers and arrays
- How to use strings and how to manipulate them
- Scope of variables


# Requirements
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are not allowed to use the standard library. Any use of functions like `printf`, `puts`, etc… is forbidden
- You are allowed to use [_putchar](https://github.com/holbertonschool/_putchar.c/blob/master/_putchar.c)
- You don’t have to push `_putchar.c`, we will use our file. If you do it won’t be taken into account
- In the following examples, the `main.c` files are shown as examples. You can use them to test your functions, but you don’t have to push them to your repo (if you do we won’t take them into account). We will use our own `main.c` files at compilation. Our `main.c` files might be different from the one shown in the examples
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Don’t forget to push your header file

# More Info
You do not need to learn about pointers to functions, pointers to pointers, multidimensional arrays, arrays of structures, `malloc` and `free` - yet.
