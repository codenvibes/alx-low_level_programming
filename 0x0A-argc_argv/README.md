[how to compile with unused variables]()

# Learning Objectives
- How to use arguments passed to your program
- What are two prototypes of `main` that you know of, and in which case do you use one or the other
- How to use `__attribute__((unused))` or `(void)` to compile functions with unused variables or parameters

# Requirements
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- The prototypes of all your functions and the prototype of the function `_putchar` should be included in your header file called `main.h`
- Donâ€™t forget to push your header file
